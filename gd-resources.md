# Graphic Design ressources and where to find them.

This is a living collection of resources I’ve found across the web. I’m trying to put it into a format, that’s a little more structured making it easier for someone wanting to learn what graphic design is all about. It’s made with TTRPGs in mind but can be used as a general foundation. If you want to point out a broken link, say thank you, or argue with me – I’m at [https://twitter.com/philthedane](https://twitter.com/philthedane) 

I suggest you just follow each link, starting from the top. If you’re looking for resources and not information go to the second section.

## Let’s learn something about:

## Grids

If you don’t know what a grid is, start reading this primer:
[https://web.archive.org/web/20220331115302/https://www.theexplorersco.com/home/2019/7/20/exploring-layout](https://web.archive.org/web/20220331115302/https://www.theexplorersco.com/home/2019/7/20/exploring-layout)

If you want a book on the matter, the two primers on grids are:
**Grid System in Raster Design** by Josef Müeller
**Making or Breaking the Grid** by Timothy Samara

## Typography:

If you want to read a primer on typography, start with this website/book by Matthew Butterick:

If you hungry for other practical lessons about typography, Johan Nohr (Designer of Mörk Borg) has two Twitter-threads:
